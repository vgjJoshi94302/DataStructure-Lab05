-the second will consist of an image and textThink of the first xml file as the physical view for your data structure, and the second xml as the physical view of the element that will be used within your data structure.
Two (2) java files
-Custom Adapter – this class consists of the items that will be the nodes for data structure in the custom layout. 
Eachnode will consist of a position ID, a Text View, and an Image View.
-Main Activity – Here you will create your data structure that will hold all your text that you will display in each node, as well as your ListAdapter which will reference your Custom Adapter that you will pass your text data structure to.
Every time you click on an item in your list will produce a toast message of the text within that node.Here is a screenshot
